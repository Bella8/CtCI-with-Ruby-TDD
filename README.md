# Cracking the Coding Interview - in Ruby with Rspec/TDD

Ruby solutions to various questions in the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

Also included are other puzzles given to me on coding intervews and/or ones that I just found interesting.

##Running the tests

You can run the tests for each individual exercise as follows:
  <code>rspec <chapter>/<exercise></code>
So, for example, to run the spec for exercise 9.4a\_subsets.rb, you would:
  <code>rspec chapter\_09/9.4a\_subsets.rb</code>
