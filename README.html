<h1>Cracking the Coding Interview - in Ruby with Rspec/TDD</h1>

<p>Ruby solutions to various questions in the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.</p>

<p>Also included are other puzzles given to me on coding intervews and/or ones that I just found interesting.</p>

<h2>Running the tests</h2>

<p>You can run the tests for each individual exercise as follows:
  <code>rspec <chapter>/<exercise></code>
So, for example, to run the spec for exercise 9.4a_subsets.rb, you would:
  <code>rspec chapter_09/9.4a_subsets.rb</code></p>
